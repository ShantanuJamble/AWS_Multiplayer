#Project Motivation:

This is a research project where I am building the multiplayer code on top of AWS infrastructure.

# Plan:

	1. Build microservices for the Login, Gameplay, Temelmetry.
	2. Research different AWS services and choose best suited for the use case.
	3. Testing for scaling and support.
